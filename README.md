# TwitterCrawler

Part 1:
Use the Twitter Streaming API to collect geolocated tweets. Store tweets in large files of about 10 MB, one tweet per row.

If a tweet contains a URL to an html page, get title of that page, and add title as an additional field of the tweet, that is, include it in the JSON of the tweet, so it becomes searchable in Part B. 
Hint: Retrieving title in real time may slow down your Twitter stream and  lead to lost data.

In both cases, you should collect at least 2 GB of data.
